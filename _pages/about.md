I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. as a fourth-year candidate at Northeastern University’s Augmented Cognition Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Sarah Ostadabbas](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ostadabbas-sarah/) within the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/). Prior to this, I completed my Masterate at George Washington University’s [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.gwu.edu/), where I was mentored by [Prof. Murray Loew](https://engineering.gwu.edu/murray-loew). My research primarily explores deep learning techniques for computer vision, focusing on video understanding, segmentation, and 3D scene reconstruction.
