I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. as a fourth-year candidate at Northeastern University’s Augmented Cognition Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Sarah Ostadabbas](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ostadabbas-sarah/) within the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree at George Washington University’s [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.gwu.edu/), where I was mentored by [Prof. Murray Loew](https://engineering.gwu.edu/murray-loew). My research primarily explores deep learning techniques for computer vision, focusing on video understanding, segmentation, and 3D scene reconstruction.

Research Interests
======

My primary interests lie in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, specifically focusing on:

- 3D Scene Understanding & Reconstruction
- Video Understanding and Segmentation
- Human Facial and Body Pose Estimation

Other than the domains above, I also have the research experience in the field of machine learning techniques in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
