I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate student in [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/), [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. as a fourth-year candidate at Northeastern University’s Augmented Cognition Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Sarah Ostadabbas](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ostadabbas-sarah/) within the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree at George Washington University’s [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.gwu.edu/), where I was mentored by [Prof. Murray Loew](https://engineering.gwu.edu/murray-loew). My research primarily explores deep learning techniques for computer vision, focusing on video understanding, segmentation, and 3D scene reconstruction.
