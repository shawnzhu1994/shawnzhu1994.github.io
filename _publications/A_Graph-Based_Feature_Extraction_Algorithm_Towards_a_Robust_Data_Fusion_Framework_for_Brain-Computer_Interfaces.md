The topological information hidden in the EEG spectral dynamics is often ignored in the majority of the existing brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Moreover, a systematic multimodal fusion of EEG with other informative brain signals such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) towards enhancing the performance of the BCI systems is not fully investigated. In this study, we present a robust EEG-fNIRS data fusion framework utilizing a series of graph-based EEG features to investigate their performance on a motor imaginary (MI) classification task.
