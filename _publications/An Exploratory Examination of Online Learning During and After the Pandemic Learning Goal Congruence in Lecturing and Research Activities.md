The COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns have engendered substantial alterations in the roles of faculty members regarding the teaching, learning, and mentoring of students, along with remarkable transformations in their research methodologies. This chapter aims to decode this recent phenomenon by exploring the challenges and opportunities presented in the virtual teaching and learning space. Using a semistructured interview study, this chapter explores the differences between traditional in-person education and virtual education, along with numerous approaches to online teaching and learning and their impact on educational practice. Four distinct viewpoints are taken, namely, (1) the challenges of online and hybrid teaching, (2) types of collaborative work with students, (3) levels of collaboration, and (4) technology issues. The chapter endeavors to shed new light on the contemporary issues confronted by educators and students during and after the pandemic.
