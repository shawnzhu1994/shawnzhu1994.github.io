This chapter introduces a motorized camera system designed for monitoring and evaluating the tests of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). This system targets physical performance assessment for older patients undergoing cancer treatment. The device is self-contained, incorporating a small computer, three cameras, and two motors. The core algorithms utilize three object recognition techniques: template matching, Haar cascades, and Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking. To facilitate user interaction, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are developed on the small computer, enabling test execution and camera adjustments via cell phone and its hotspot. The system delivers precise results, with gait speed tests showing a range of 0.041â€“1.92 m/s and average speed and distance accuracies exceeding 95%. The standing balance and 5 times sit-stand (5TSS) tests achieve average time accuracies exceeding 97%. This novel camera-based device holds promise in enhancing evaluation of lower body extremity fitness for elderly people receiving cancer health care, offering a reliable and efficient solution for monitoring their progress and well-being.
