Despite continuous research, communication approaches based on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are not yet an efficient and reliable means that severely disabled patients can rely on. To date, most motor imagery (MI)-based BCI systems use conventional spectral analysis methods to extract discriminative features and classify the associated electroencephalogram (EEG)-based sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) dynamics that results in relatively low performance. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and complex network theory graph-based feature extraction methods as a novel way to improve MI-BCIs performance. Rooted in chaos theory, these features explore the nonlinear dynamics underlying the MI neural responses as a new informative dimension in classifying MI.
